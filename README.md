=============
Guardian helps server admins combat the use of hacked clients and spambots. It analyses the behavior of players and can prevent malicious gameplay. The plugin offers a lot of customizability and can be connected across multiple servers in case it is used in a server network context. Guardian is based on gravitylow's AntiCheat and has been around since 2012.

Installation
------------
Guardian **requires** you to have ProtocolLib. You can download it [here](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/protocollib.1997/).
Simply drag and drop the Guardian and ProtocolLib jars in your plugin folder. You can now use Guardian, but be sure to have a look at the configuration files, which allow you to change every aspect of the plugin.
