## Reporting a Vulnerability
We take the security of Guardian and its users very seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability within Guardian, we encourage you to report it to us promptly. Your efforts help ensure the safety and integrity of our software.

### Reporting Process
To report a vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Contact**: Send an email to security@gac.lol with a detailed description of the vulnerability. Please provide as much information as possible, including the steps to reproduce the issue and any potential impact.
2. **Acknowledgment**: You will receive an acknowledgment email from our security team within 48 hours of your report.
3. **Investigation**: Our team will review your report and conduct an initial assessment of the vulnerability. We may ask for additional information if needed.
4. **Resolution**: Once the vulnerability is confirmed and addressed, we will develop and test a fix.
5. **Disclosure**: We strive to maintain responsible and coordinated disclosure. We will work with you to determine an appropriate timeline for disclosing the vulnerability to the public after it has been fully resolved.

### Rewards
As a token of our appreciation for helping us improve Guardian's security, we may offer rewards to individuals who responsibly disclose security vulnerabilities. The rewards may vary based on the severity and impact of the vulnerability.
Please note that this is a fully free open-source project, and we do not earn anything from Guardian. Your contributions are very welcome and we will credit you for your discovery, if requested.

### Guidelines
While engaging in security research, we kindly ask that you:
- Refrain from publicly disclosing the vulnerability before it has been resolved and properly disclosed.
- Avoid exploiting the vulnerability beyond what is necessary to demonstrate its existence.

We are committed to working with security researchers to address any issues promptly and ensure a safe experience for all Guardian users.
Thank you for your contribution to the security of Guardian and the protection of our user community. Your efforts make a meaningful difference in maintaining a secure environment for Minecraft players.
